# Silhouette Cameo 4 Pen Holder
## Overview
A 3D printable pen-holder tool for the Silhouette Cameo 4 cutter designed to be as attractive, functional and useful as the original manufacturer's part.

As per the original holder, this version comes with small, medium and large pen-holders and a cap to easily set the correct level for the pen nib.

The whole design is 3D printable with no need for any addition hardware.

## Printing instructions
The model has been printed and tested on the Prusa MK3S/MMU2S printer using Prusament PETG filament. All parts fit on a 20x20 printing bed.

### Recommended print settings

Print settings (for Prusa Slicer) are the same for all included parts:

* Material: PETG
* Layer: 0.20mm (Quality)
* Infill: 15%
* Supports: No Supports

## Assembly
Once printed press the cap onto the top of the holder (if it is a little tight, simply put the cap on and off a few times to losen it up).  The pen adapters simply screw in (the thread should be ready-to-go straight off the printer).
